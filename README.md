## User Story

```

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
